Applied **Electron Beam Lithography (EBL)** to pattern electrodes **on exfoliated hBN flakes**.

Fabricated a hBN-WS2-hBN heterostructure using Polycarbonate (PC) film, where the WS2 layer was grown by
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).

Acquired the carrier mobility by measuring the **drain current (Id) versus gate voltage (Vg) characteristics** using a
semiconductor probe station as shown below.
