Improved the polycarbonate(PC) based method for twisted bilayer graphene to fabricate twisted multilayer STO grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition(PLD) , which can control the angle more precisely than most reported propylene carbonate(PPC) transfer.

Achieved twisted bilayer STO on SiO2/Si and working on fabricating twisted four-layer STO transferred on Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM) grids.

Plan to Observe moiré patterns and the atomic arrangement at the bilayer interface through TEM and 4D-ScanningTransmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), and expect to observe distinct features through Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG).

Here shows the process of fabrication.
