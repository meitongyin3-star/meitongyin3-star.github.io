Established **high-intensity surface acoustic waves (SAWs)** as a powerful tool for **controlling carrier dynamics** in 2D
materials.

Measured the dependence of wave intensity (I) and carrier density (n) on acoustoelectric current (JAE) , observing a
transition from linear to nonlinear transport as shown below.

Mainly completed the **exfoliation and fabrication** of hBN-encapsulated graphene samples on a LiNbO3 substrate
using polycarbonate (PC).

Actively contributed to addressing reviewer comments during the peer-review process of the manuscript submitted
to Nano Letters in March 2025
