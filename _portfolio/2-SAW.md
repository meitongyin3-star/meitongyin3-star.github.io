Established high-intensity surface acoustic waves (SAWs) as a powerful tool for controlling carrier dynamics in 2D materials.  

Measured the dependence of wave intensity (I) and carrier density (n) on acoustoelectric current (J<sub>AE</sub>), observing a transition from linear to nonlinear transport as shown below.

Mainly completed the exfoliation and fabrication of hBN-encapsulated graphene samples on a LiNbO₃ substrate using polycarbonate (PC).  

Actively contributed to addressing reviewer comments during the peer-review process of the manuscript submitted to *Nano Letters* in March 2025.
