I guided students to independently design experiments for given research topics, assisted them in fabricating customized devices using 3D printing, and provided advice on data analysis. This experience closely resembled the mentorship in real scientific research, giving me a strong sense of fulfillment and reinforcing my determination to pursue a professorship in academia.

Project — Investigation of Factors Affecting the Flight Trajectory of Paper Boomerangs
======
I supervised the undergraduate student project exploring how the shape, size, and launch parameters of paper boomerangs influence their flight trajectories. Through discussion, we concluded that hand throwing was unsuitable for controlled experiments due to poor repeatability and lack of parameter tuning. One student independently designed a 3D-printed launcher based on a compressed-spring mechanism, while another built an elastic-band launcher—both allowing precise adjustment of launch conditions.

A major challenge was tracking the flight path. I suggested combining aerial footage from a drone with ground-based height-projection videos, while students proposed using an elevated camera stand. The latter provided higher stability and resolution. In data analysis, I encouraged the team to examine the relationship between curvature and time, as their trajectories deviated from the circular paths reported in literature. We attributed this to differences in boomerang geometry.

This experience deepened my understanding of experimental design and student mentorship, reinforcing my aspiration to pursue a future academic career.
