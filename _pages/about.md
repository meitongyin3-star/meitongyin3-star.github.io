## 🎓 Biography

**Meitong Yin** is an undergraduate student majoring in **Condensed Matter Physics** with a minor in **Computer Science and Technology** at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, expecting to graduate in 2026. Her research interests lie in **quantum materials, low-dimensional systems, and acoustoelectric phenomena**, with a particular focus on **dynamic carrier modulation in van der Waals heterostructures**.

She is currently a **research intern in [Prof. Seung Sae Hong’s group](https://mse.engineering.ucdavis.edu/people/seung-sae-hong)** at the **University of California, Davis**, where she develops *precise angle-controlled fabrication techniques for twisted multilayer SrTiO₃ (STO)* grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), aiming to investigate **moiré superlattices** through advanced microscopy techniques such as TEM and PFM.

Previously, she worked with **[Prof. Luis A. Jauregui](https://sites.uci.edu/qmdl/luis-a-jauregui/)** at UC Irvine on **nonlinear acoustoelectric transport in 2D materials**. Her work established *high-intensity surface acoustic waves (SAWs)* as a powerful means to tune carrier dynamics, contributing substantially to a publication titled  
> *“Dynamic Carrier Modulation via Nonlinear Acoustoelectric Transport in van der Waals Heterostructures,”*  
published in *Nano Letters (2025)*.

At USTC, Meitong also led a project on **hBN–WS₂–hBN heterostructure fabrication using electron beam lithography (EBL)** under **[Prof. Hong Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wanghong1/zh_CN/index.htm)**, focusing on nanoscale device patterning and carrier mobility characterization.

Beyond research, she has served as a **teaching assistant** for *Solid State Physics A* and *College Physics Experimental* courses, demonstrating both technical depth and mentoring ability.
