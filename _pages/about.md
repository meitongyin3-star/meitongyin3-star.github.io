## 🎓 Biography

Growing up in *Shihezi*, a small city in *Xinjiang Province* in northwestern China, **Meitong Yin** entered the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** in the fall of 2022 with an excellent score on the *Gaokao* examination. Motivated by her dream of becoming a physicist, she chose **Condensed Matter Physics** as her major. To strengthen her computational foundation and support her physics research, she began pursuing a minor in **Computer Science and Technology** in 2023. Her research interests lie in **quantum materials, low-dimensional systems, and nanostructures**, with a particular focus on **2D materials and their heterostructures**.

She is currently a **research intern in [Prof. Seung Sae Hong’s group](https://mse.engineering.ucdavis.edu/people/seung-sae-hong)** at the **University of California, Davis**, where she develops *precise angle-controlled fabrication techniques for twisted multilayer SrTiO₃ (STO)* grown by **pulsed laser deposition (PLD)**. Her current work aims to investigate **moiré superlattices** through advanced microscopy techniques such as **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** and **Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM)**.

Previously, she worked with **[Prof. Luis A. Jauregui](https://sites.uci.edu/qmdl/luis-a-jauregui/)** at **UC Irvine** on **nonlinear acoustoelectric transport in 2D materials**. The project she participated in demonstrated *high-intensity surface acoustic waves (SAWs)* as a powerful means to modulate carrier dynamics, contributing substantially to the publication  
> *“Dynamic Carrier Modulation via Nonlinear Acoustoelectric Transport in van der Waals Heterostructures,”*  
published in *Nano Letters (2025)*.

At **USTC**, Meitong also led a project on **hBN–WS₂–hBN heterostructure fabrication using electron-beam lithography (EBL)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Hong Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wanghong1/zh_CN/index.htm)**, focusing on improving film transfer quality and characterizing carrier mobility.

Beyond research, she has served as a **teaching assistant** for *Solid State Physics A* and *College Physics Experiments*, demonstrating both technical expertise and mentoring ability.
