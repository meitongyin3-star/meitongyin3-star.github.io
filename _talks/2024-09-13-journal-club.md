This presentation introduces correlated and topological phases in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Electron transport measurements reveal a correlated insulating state at charge neutrality (n = 0, D = 0) and several Chern insulator phases with quantized Hall resistance (C = −5 and −3). These states emerge without moiré superlattices, driven instead by electron interactions and symmetry breaking in the layered structure. Phase diagrams, magnetotransport data, and temperature dependence confirm tunable transitions among band, correlated, and Chern insulators. The work demonstrates that rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a highly controllable platform for exploring strongly correlated and quantum anomalous Hall phenomena, establishing layer thickness and displacement field as key parameters for next-generation topological materials research
