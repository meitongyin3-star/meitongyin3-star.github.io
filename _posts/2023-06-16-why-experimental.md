In my freshman year, I was assigned an experimental project titled **How ink generates fractal patterns on an acrylic surface** as part of my university’s physics course. It was my first hands-on physics project, through which I learned the complete process of conducting scientific research—from reviewing reference papers to designing experiments and analyzing data. Most importantly, I successfully completed the project and discovered my genuine interest in performing physics experiments.

Project: How ink generates fractal patterns on an acrylic surface
======

After reviewing relevant literature, I concluded that the formation of fractal patterns was primarily driven by surface tension, which was affected by temperature, density, and the types of both ink and acrylic used. To verify this, I designed experiments that **varied temperature and solution concentration**. Here are some images of the resulting fractal patterns:

After completing the experiments, I used *ImageJ* to calculate the fractal dimensions and found that when the ratio of ink to alcohol was **1:3**, the fractal dimension reached its maximum value.

Following my presentation, I received a high evaluation for this work. Through this experience, I discovered a deep enthusiasm for experimental physics, which later motivated me to participate in the *National College Student Physics Innovation Experiment Competition* a few months afterward. Furthermore, in my third year, I became a Teaching Assistant for the *College Physics Experimental* course to guide other students in their own research projects.

I planted a pot of gardenias that spring to commemorate this beautiful experience.
