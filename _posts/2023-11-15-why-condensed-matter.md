In my freshman year, I collaborated with three peers in the project focused on the **conductivity of graphite and its potential application in seismic wave detection**. We earned Second Prize (Top 15%) in the National College Student Physics Innovation Experiment Competition.

Project: Seismic Wave Detection Experiment Based on Graphite Conductivity
======

We investigated the impact of **temperature, magnetic field, bending stress** on graphite conductivity, and the principles of various seismic wave detectors. Here is one image shows how we used four-probe method to measure the influence of temperature to graphite conductivity.

I Measured resistance (R) - temperature (T) graph for graphite sheet and further with applying bending stress. Here are the results.

This project sparked my passion for materials science and motivated me to delve deeper into condensed matter physics—particularly two-dimensional (2D) materials, given their close relation to graphite. This interest eventually led me to join the surface acoustic wave project on graphene at UC Irvine. Here is a photo of our group.
