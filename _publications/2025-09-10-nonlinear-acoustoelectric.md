Dynamically manipulating carrier distributions in van der Waals heterostructures opens pathways to realizing solid-state quantum simulators with tunable lattice parameters. In this study, we report **nonlinear acoustoelectric transport** and **dynamic carrier modulation** in boron nitride–encapsulated graphene coupled to strong **surface acoustic waves (SAWs)** on LiNbO₃ substrates. As the SAW intensity increases, the acoustoelectric current transitions from a linear to a nonlinear regime, leading to the formation of **periodic carrier stripes**—alternating regions of electrons and holes—without the need for static gates.

By using counter-propagating SAWs, we generate **standing surface acoustic waves (SSAWs)** that dynamically manipulate charge distributions, revealing tunable potential barriers and **carrier localization** effects. The saturation of acoustoelectric current density, attenuation transitions, and resistance peaks under SSAW conditions confirm strong carrier confinement.  

These results establish SAWs as a versatile and reconfigurable platform for **dynamic control of charge in 2D materials**, offering a promising route toward **acoustic lattices for quantum simulation** and **time-dependent electronic systems**.
